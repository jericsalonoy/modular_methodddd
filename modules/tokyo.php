<h1>Tokyo</h1>
<p>Tokyo is the capital city of Japan and one of the most populous cities in the world. It is located on the eastern coast of the island of Honshu, the largest of Japan's islands. Tokyo is not only the political and economic heart of Japan, but also a vibrant global metropolis, known for its blend of traditional culture and cutting-edge modernity.</p>

<p>Historically, Tokyo was originally a small fishing village called Edo. The city rose to prominence in the early 17th century when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate, Japan's military government. It wasn’t until the late 19th century, following the Meiji Restoration, that the city was renamed Tokyo, meaning "Eastern Capital," as the imperial capital was moved from Kyoto.</p>

<p>Today, Tokyo is one of the most influential cities in the world. It is renowned for its towering skyscrapers, bustling shopping districts like Shibuya and Shinjuku, and a never-ending mix of neon lights and traditional temples. Tokyo is a major global financial center and is home to several of the world’s largest companies, including Sony, Toyota, and Mitsubishi.</p>
